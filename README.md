# MIPTakinator

This is an akinator, simple artificial intelligence, that can guess the teacher from MIPT.

Implemented on the basis of a binary tree. If AI does not know the teacher, it becomes possible to add him to the database, which is stored in `configFile.txt`

# Install
You must have installed `g++`. The program is compiled by using `make`

# How to use?
Execute `./akinator`, there will be instructions inside.

# Dump
For debug view of binary tree you should install `graphviz` and `xdot`
``` bash
yum install graphviz
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
pip install xdot
```
